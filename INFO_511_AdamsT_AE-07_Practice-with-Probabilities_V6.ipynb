    "> - **Age** – older, retired individuals might drink less coffee and be at higher risk of death  \n",
    "> - **Health** – people with chronic cardiac or hypertensive conditions are more likely to avoid coffee  \n",
    "> - **Lifestyle** – coffee drinkers might have other consumption patterns we can't identify from this cohort\n"
